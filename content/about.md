I'm a programming enthusiast from the DFW area. I generally go by **jpadkins** online. If you see someone with that name, chances are it's me.

I've got a thing for webdev, Ruby, C, CRPGS, Roguelikes, cult/exploitation/B films, old pulp sci-fi and fantasy novels, comparative mythology, and IRL exploration, so that's what you can expect me to write about. Mostly.

### Q & A

Q: Why does your website look like it was designed by someone in the 90s?

A: Because I believe you should be able to disable JS without a site losing readability. If you want to browse jpa.io from links or w3m, you deserve nothing but the full browser experience. Also I've grown attached to the style of late-90s/early-00s tech blogs and documentation sites.

Q: Some of the code you've posted has a bug or could be improved. Can I contact you?

A: Yes! I'd greatly appreciate it, in fact. [This](https://github.com/jpadkins/jpa.io_hugo) is a link to the repo storing the **Hugo** project I generate this site from. Please open a PR there. Otherwise, at the footer of any page you'll find a link to my github profile, which contains my email.

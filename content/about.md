This is the personal blog of **Jacob Paul Adkins**. I'm a programming enthusiast from the DFW area. I generally go by **jpadkins** online. If you see someone with that name, chances are it's me.

I've got a thing for webdev, C, CRPGS, Roguelikes, Film (Mainly 60s art house, 70s exploitation, 80s/90s B-action), old pulp sci-fi, and IRL exploration, so that's what you can expect me to write about. Mostly.

### Q & A

Q: Why does your website look like it was designed by someone in the 90s who couldn't care less?

A: Because I believe you should be able to disable JS without a site losing readability. Because I care about those of us using screen readers. And because if you want to browse jpa.io from links or w3m, you deserve nothing but the full browser experience. And, oddly enough, I've grown to love the style of late-90s/early-00s tech blogs and documentation sites.

Q: Some of the code you've posted has a bug or could be improved. Can I contact you?

A: Yes! I'd greatly appreciate it, in fact. [This](https://github.com/jpadkins/jpa.io_hugo) is a link to the repo storing the **Hugo** project I generate this site from. Please open a PR there. Otherwise, at the footer of any page you'll find links to my github profile, which contains my email.
